&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For my second year at UT, I am officially living off-campus. I secured an two-bedroom apartment with a friend that I met at church, and we just moved in today (at least partially). The exterior of the building is pretty lackluster. The building was made probably 50 years ago and a lot of the wooden decking on the entry way is rotting out, but the interior looks good as new. Both bedrooms have completely new carpet and the rest of the unit is pretty clean. The only annoying thing is that the majority of the outlets aren't even grounded, so we had to replace one of them to plug in my computer (nobody will notice). I'm a little scared to have to cook all my meals on my own, but I'm also really happy that I'll have my own bedroom again. The city is already pretty crowded, and having to share a room with someone at the end of the day just makes it feel that much more so. Hopefully now I'll be able to have some quiet time alone and be a little less stressed.
