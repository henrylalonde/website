&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By far the biggest thing I've ever put into the poor Shop Smith's lathe, the PK Pounder is an oversized cedar bat made from a stupid big log that I found outside. It took pretty much all day to get it down to the size it is now, and I left it the size it is now because I didn't have the motivation to make it the size of a normal bat (and how lame would that be anyways!). Finished off with some stain and polyurethane, the bat now leans against my bunk at PK. I wouldn't recommend hitting anything hard with it because there is a very real possibility that it will snap in half.
