    "content": "This summer, I got to spend my workdays going to the Servolution Dream Center for an internship with the Home to Texas Program. Though Servolution primarily deals with home repairs, furniture/appliance donations, and food distribution, I was there to help with technology. I spent lots of time figuring out how to write Google Sheets functions, even more time figuring out how to write Javascript, and helping out where I was needed whenever necessary. By the end, I had built them an automation pipeline that brings new applications into their project management software, Trello. Before, they were paying for Jotform and Zapier to do this for them, but after I finished coding up my solution, those expenses were no longer necessary. Google Apps Script is pretty op (I definitely recommend it if you are doing anything that needs to interface with Google Sheets or an external API). I am glad that I was able to learn so much about spreadsheets, too, because now I will get to show off my skills to my friends (Yo bro, watch me MAP(A2:A13, B2:B13, C2:C13, LAMBDA(pos, vel, acc, CONATENATE(pos, vel, acc))) all this data)"
