    Whether it be a lake trip or a camp out, we've had many friends out to Possum Kingdom, and one of the defining aspects of every PK outing is the opportunity to drive the Honda Pioneer. However, this four-wheel-drive offroading monster is much faster than it has any right to be, and that has led to some rather unfortunate accidents. It's been rolled, crashed into trees, stabbed with branches, and taken more of a beating than any other vehicle owned by the Lalonde family. And for some reason, these accidents only occur when one of our friends is behind the wheel. This mural on the garage floor at PK represents the inherency of the silly goose mindset to anyone given the keys to this UTV.
