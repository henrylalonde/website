&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will preface by saying that the image is slightly misleading. This was on the week of their first exam, so everyone was super nervous and looking for any possible resources to prepare. My usual sessions consist of 8-16 people. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This semester I got a job with the Sanger Learning Center as an SI Leader (Supplemental Instruction). This was my first semester doing school and work at the same time, but it was the perfect balance in my opinion because this wasn't any ordinary job. In this job, I attend the lectures for ECE 302: Intro to Electrical Engineering, prepare lesson plans and practice problems, and hold two tutoring sessions every week. Basically, I got to make money by being nerdy and helping others: two of my favorite things to do in life. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was always pretty afraid of speaking in front of others, but I've come to find that as long as I know what I'm talking, the nerves pretty much disappear. I've lead small and large groups of students through difficult topics, all while keeping the atmosphere light, and it's been surprisingly fulfilling. I'll find myself putting extra effort into the lesson plans just because I want the students to get the most out of each session. Maybe that's a sign I should try to become a professor...
